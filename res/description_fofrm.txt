# 
# fps to 
# the Frame Per of Second, the number of frames per second. 
# An integer, unsigned. Not Required. 
# Default - 10. 
# 
# the count 
# The number of frames in the animation. 
# An integer, unsigned. 
# Default - 1. 
# 
# offs_x 
# offs_y 
. # Basic offset 
# This shift is necessary to ensure that staff They are properly centered. 
# used when the frame is displayed, since its logical center is not always the same as 
# with its absolute center (width / 2, height / 2). Naprmer center creatures will position his feet, 
# while the center of the tree will be its base. 
# A positive value for offs_x means that when displaying the frame will be moved to the right. 
# A positive value for offs_y means that the frame under the map will be shifted down. 
# Integer landmark. Not Required. 
# Default - 0. 
# 
# [? Dir_] 
# blocks before animation frames descriptions put the direction of the animation. 
#? this direction, in the range from 0 to 5. 
# The frames without regard to the direction it may be omitted. 
# The following are descriptions of the elements of the animation block. 
# 
# offs_x 
# offs_y 
# Offset for directions. If they are not specified, the global base offsets are taken. 
# Integer landmark. Not Required. 
# The default - value base of global * offs_. 
# 
# Next_x_? 
# Next_y_? 
# Offset frame relative to the previous frame. ? is the frame number. * 
# Integer landmark. Not Required. 
# Default - 0. 
# 
# frm_? 
# Image file name. ? is the frame number. * 
# For the first frame number is not required, ie, a "of frm = ...". 
# must include the path to the current folder. 
# string. Required. 
# 
# * The numbers must start at 0 and go step by step.

Added ability to set the overall frame offsets for each of the areas. If the data is not found, then taken global.
Extended specification. Now for animations without directions (or zero direction) indicate the beginning of the block "[dir_0]" is not necessary. 
It is also not necessary to specify the first frame in the animation of its number, ie, You can not "frm_0 = ...", but simply "of frm = ...". 
"the count" is no longer a required parameter, the default - 1.
